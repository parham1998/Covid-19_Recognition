### coronaviruses

      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that were discovered in the 1960s. 
      these diseases are naturally present in birds and mammals. 
      But so far, seven types of coronaviruses have been discovered that can be transmitted from person to person. 
      One of these coronaviruses that have recently affected the lives of the world is an acute respiratory syndrome or Covid-19. 
      The outbreak of the virus started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and within a few months, it became a global epidemic.

### chest dataset

      One way to diagnose the disease is to have a chest scan. That is, the chest is photographed and the health of the lungs is carefully monitored.
      Naturally, we need data to diagnose corona with deep learning. 
      
      The corona-positive CT scan data set that we will use for this training was collected by Joseph Cohen, Ph.D., University of Montreal.
      For corona-negative data or normal samples, we use the Chest X-Ray Images database from the Kaggle site. 

      Eventually, we will have a database in which we can train a deep network.
